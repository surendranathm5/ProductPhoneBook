This Java code creates a product phonebook using a HashMap.  It allows users to add, find, remove, and update product information (name, price, rating).  The program provides a menu-driven interface for user interaction via the console.  Users can search for products within a price range or above a certain rating.  Input validation is included for basic error handling. The code demonstrates object-oriented principles with a `Product` class.  The `Scanner` class is used to take custom input from the user. Finally, the program allows clearing all products and exiting.
